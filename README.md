## About
Music is an integral part of many peoples' lives. Most of us hear it every day, from popular songs on the radio to even a phone ringtone, but we sometimes forget how that music is created. Musication aims to expose people to the various types of instruments, providing a little bit of history and information on common instruments while showing how the instrument looks and sounds like and the pieces it can play.

The site holds lots of in-depth pictures, videos, and information about various instruments, as well as a quiz that puts people's instrument knowledge and recognition skills to the test.  Hopefully, with this newfound knowledge, people will be able to detect certain instruments a song or piece they're listening to uses while having a greater understanding and appreciation for music in general.
